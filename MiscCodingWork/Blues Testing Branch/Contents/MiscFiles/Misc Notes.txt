Things I need to translate into events and when to run them

on start
    - Initialize the tables, make sure that the game knows they exist.
        - Might want to get more granular? Initialize ALL the drug data, not just the tables?

    - Check for the current drug tier in the player
         If >= 1, use this to trigger the drug effects.

    - Check for Overdose? If you do this, make sure to have a variable that tracks if the player is CURRENTLY having an
            overdose. That way you don't accidentally trigger the OD failed uptick twice
         This should not check the players toxicity, only some value that sets their overdose.
         Should work basically identically to the drug effects but in reverse.


 -------------------------------------------------

IDEA -
    Have the function listed in the drug info table be what will check the drug tier(?)
    But- that function should be the one that initializes your events. It can check for the current tier
    and depending on that tier, it can trigger different effects. That would make it super useful
    as you have been struggling with setting up a system to trigger those events in a straightforward way.
