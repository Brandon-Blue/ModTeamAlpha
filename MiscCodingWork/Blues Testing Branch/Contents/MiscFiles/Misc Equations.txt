Potency Calc
    - On consume, check against traits, multiplies the end value by a set of modifiers.

    Modifiers of Potency Based on Traits
    --------------------------
    Obese               - 0.75
    Overweight          - 0.9
    Underweight         - 1.1
    Very Underweight    - 1.25
    Emaciated           - 1.5

    Iron Gut            - 0.9
    Weak Stomach        - 1.1
    --------------------------

    In effect, a player who is severely overweight/underweight will have different degrees of effect from taking
    the same drug, with the same base potency value.

    At most-
    65% increase, from Emaciated & Weak Stomach
    32.5% decrease, from Obese & Iron Gut

    Means that the impact of drugs is always relatively close to the 'normal', but there are more ways to increase
    the relative severity as opposed to decrease. No one escapes.



OD Chance Calc
    - When taking a drug, the value of cumulative potency values will be checked against a threshold.
    - If greater than the threshold, there is a chance to OD.

    CumPot = Cumulative potency effecting the player.

    Threshold = The cut-off potency value for ODing.

    Extra = ( CumPot - Threshold )

    OD Modifiers = Anything we deem should have an impact on the players likelihood of ODing. Addiction,
                    traits, health, whatever.

    OD Chance = (Extra) * OD Modifiers


    - Additionally, it is worth considering if we track the potency of drug use cumulatively across ALL drugs,
        or if we treat them individually / categorically.

            Personally leaning towards tracking the cumulative total across ALL drug use, for the sake
            of simplicity in the triggering of an overdose, while also giving us the ability to have
            functions in place to check the value of the



OD Happening Check
    - Using the 'OD Chance' variable from above, we will roll a number to see if the player will actually have an
        overdose upon passing the threshold.
    - ZombRand() function will generate a random number, which will allow us to add an element of randomness.

    if ZombRand() <= OD Chance, then the player will suffer an Overdose.
